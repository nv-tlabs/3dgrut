):
    r"""Default ray generation function for perfect wide-angle fisheye cameras.

    Fisheye cameras map wide angles to screen space by introducing distortion towards the edge of the image,
    e.g. straight lines get mapped to curves in the projected image.

    This raygen function uses equidistant mapping, which preserves angular distances
    e.g. if two locations are THETA angles apart in world coordinates, they will be equally spaced in the
    projected image.
    The exact mapping is characterized by the field of view.

    Note: This function does not concern non-ideal distortion parameters, such as
    radial, tangential distortion parameters.

    Args:
        camera (kaolin.render.camera.Camera): A single camera object (batch size 1).
        coords_grid (Tuple[torch.FloatTensor, torch.FloatTensor], optional):
            x and y pixel grid of ray-intersecting coordinates of shape :math:`(\text{H, W})`.
            Coordinates integer parts represent the pixel :math:`(\text{i, j})` coords, and the fraction part of
            :math:`[\text{0,1}]` represents the location within the pixel itself.
            For example, a coordinate of :math:`(\text{0.5, 0.5})` represents the center of the top-left pixel.
        eps (float):
            Numerical sensitivity parameter, used to prevent division by zero.

    Returns:
        (torch.FloatTensor, torch.FloatTensor, torch.BoolTensor):
            First and second entries are the generated rays for the camera, as ray origins and ray direction tensors of
            :math:`(\text{HxW, 3})`.

            The third entry is a boolean mask that masks in which rays fall within the field of view of the camera
            (rays outside the fov region shouldn't be rendered), of shape
            :math:`(\text{HxW, 1})`.
